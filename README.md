# SHAPE5: Specification for HDF5 Analysis, Parsing, and Encoding

`SHAPE5` is a machine-readable specification of the HDF5 file format using [GNU poke](https://www.jemarch.net/poke/) pickles.

The goal is to describe HDF5 on-disk structures as executable binary format definitions that can be loaded in GNU poke to inspect, validate, and reason about HDF5 files.

This repository is a work in progress. The current pickles focus on core HDF5 metadata structures, including the superblock, B-trees, object headers, and related messages.

## Repository Layout - Pickles

- [`pickles/common.pk`](pickles/common.pk): shared helpers and common definitions
- [`pickles/superblock.pk`](pickles/superblock.pk): HDF5 superblock definitions
- [`pickles/messages.pk`](pickles/messages.pk): object header message definitions
- [`pickles/ohdr.pk`](pickles/ohdr.pk): object header definitions
- [`pickles/btree.pk`](pickles/btree.pk): umbrella loader for version 1 and version 2 B-tree definitions
- [`pickles/v1_btree.pk`](pickles/v1_btree.pk): version 1 B-tree and symbol table node definitions
- [`pickles/v2_btree.pk`](pickles/v2_btree.pk): version 2 B-tree definitions
- [`pickles/farray.pk`](pickles/farray.pk): fixed array chunk index definitions
- [`pickles/earray.pk`](pickles/earray.pk): extensible array chunk index definitions
- [`pickles/lookup3.pk`](pickles/lookup3.pk): implementation of the lookup3 hash function used for checksums
